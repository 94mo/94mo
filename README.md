# Moses Lee

Hi, I’m Moses. Currently, I am based in Austin, working as the lead designer at [MSTL INC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mstl/about/). I am a designer, full-stack developer, and creator of web & mobile solutions with a focus on motion and user experience. If you're interested in the tools and software I use check out my [uses page](https://mosesl.co/uses/).

In my spare time, I like to write music and [experiment with new tech](https://github.com/94mo). I’m always interested in new projects, so feel free to [drop me a line](https://mosesl.co/contact).
